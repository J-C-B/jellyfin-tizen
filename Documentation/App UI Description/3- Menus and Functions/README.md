Use labeled screenshots to describe the UI elements on each application screen.

Create as many slides as you need.

Label the UI elements with numbers or text. If there are many elements, use number labels.

Describe the elements in a table.

If the screenshots are not in English, provide translations for titles, headings, and button labels.
